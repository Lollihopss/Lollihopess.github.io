    <h2>Web Development Experience</h2>
    <p>One of the most interesting things I've done with my current web development skills is I am currently working on building a website for my club GEEO, it's a slow project but I am excited to build it. </p>

    <h2>Course Expectations</h2>
    <p>I hope to learn and develop my web development skills. Despite this website not showing it, I feel like I am strong design wise and with visual planning, but actually executing these ideas  can sometimes be a challenge. I'd like to be able to envision something and just be able to code it out without any struggles.</p>
