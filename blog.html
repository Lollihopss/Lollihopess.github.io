    <h1>Assignment Reflection</h1>

    <h2>Challenges Faced and Solutions</h2>
    <p>I really am struggling with uploading it with the engineering server and using github. I have never done that before and it was just hard for me to grasp especially since I ran into the issue where it didn't have permissions. It made this assignment longer than it should have been considering its a simple hello world.</p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>I already knew how to code in html and its been a really easy refresher, but I learned more about git.</p>

    <h2>Resources Used</h2>
    <p>Not really sure? Again, the main struggles were just figuring out git, github, and the engr website.</p>
